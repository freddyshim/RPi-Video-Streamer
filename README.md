## Raspberry Pi Setup

### 1. Enabling OTG
We need to edit some files on Raspberry Pi's boot disk. Navigate to your Raspberry Pi image (eg. `/Volumes/boot` on Mac). Add the following line at the bottom of `config.txt`:
```
dtoverlay=dwc2
```
In `cmdline.txt`, add the following after the word `rootwait`:
```
modules-load=dwc2,libcomposite
```
To enable ssh over wifi, create a file called `ssh` in the `boot` image by running the command:
```
touch ssh
```
Create a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` with the following contents, replacing `COUNTRY_CODE`, `WIFI_NAME` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` with their respective contents:
```
ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
update_config=1
country=COUNTRY_CODE

network={
     ssid="WIFI_NAME"
     psk="WIFI_PASSWORD"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
}
```

### 2. SSH into Raspberry Pi
Connect your Raspberry Pi Zero to your phone via the <b>USB</b> (NOT PWR) port on the Pi. The first boot may take a few minutes. Once your Pi is fully booted, you can SSH into your Pi over wifi. Find your Pi's ip address and execute the following, replacing `IP_ADDRESS` with that of the Pi:
```
ssh-keygen -R IP_ADDRESS
ssh pi@IP_ADDRESS
```

### 3. Enable Camera
Connect your camera module to the Raspberry Pi if you already haven't done so. Then, you can find the menu to enable the camera by running the command:
```
sudo raspi-config
```

### 4. Configure Pi as a UVC Gadget
Check out a forked version of uvc-gadget:
```
git clone https://github.com/peterbay/uvc-gadget
```
This repository provides a script that creates a systemd service. To install this, copy the file to the specified location and enable it.
```
cd uvc-gadget
sudo cp piwebcam.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl enable piwebcam
```
Now, we build the uvc-gadget app. While you are in the /uvc-gadget directory, compile the repository code:
```
make
```
Enable serial connection (for app-to-pi communication):
```
sudo systemctl stop getty@ttyGS0.service
sudo systemctl disable getty@ttyGS0.service
```
Restart your Raspberry Pi. Upon next boot, your Raspberry Pi should be set up as a USB camera gadget.

## Building the Android App

### 1. Download NDK
This app has been tested with NDK version 14 which you cannot donwload directly from Android Studio. Google provides download mirrors for older versions of NDK (<16) in the following link: 
https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads/older_releases

Some modifications need to be made in the downloaded ndk. From the root directory of the NDK, change the file name of `prebuilt/YOUR_CHIP_ARCHITECTURE/bin/awk.exe` to `awk_.exe`, replacing `YOUR_CHIP_ARCHITECTURE` with your local machine's CPU architecture (eg. darwin_x86, armv6, etc.).

### 2. Compile in Android Studio
Clone this repository to your desired location and open the "rpistream" directory in Android Studio. Then, add the following line at the botoom of file "local.properties":
```
ndk.dir={NDK_LOCATION}
```
Make sure to substitute {NDK_LOCATION} with the correct path to the NDK directory.
Then, in Android Studio, go to Build > Rebuild Project and wait for the project to finish building. After, Run the "App" module on your Android device.

## Troubleshooting
#### 1. Service Not Running
On your Raspberry Pi check that the piwebcam service is running by using the command `systemctl | grep piwebcam`

If it's not then you can view the service logs using the command `journalctl -u piwebcam.service` to find the root problem.

A common problem may be that `dev/video0` is not being detected as a video device. A fix for this may be to run the command `echo "bcm2835-v4l2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules`.
